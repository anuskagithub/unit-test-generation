The corrected C unit tests using `assert.h` wrapped in `int main()` are:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    assert(add(2, 3) == 5);
    return 0;
}
```
The compiler logs indicate that there was an error in line 4 of the test code, where the `main` function was redefined. This is because the test code includes a `main` function definition, which conflicts with the one defined by the C standard library. By wrapping the `assert` statements in an `int main()` function, we avoid this conflict and ensure that the tests can run correctly.
